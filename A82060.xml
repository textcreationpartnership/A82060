            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is not unknown unto all the whole Kingdom how faithfully and zealou≈øly, we have behaved our ≈øelves in the ≈øervice of King and Parliament, and we leave all the world to judge how readily we ventured our lives, and laid out our e≈øtates, towards this work of Reformation, to the ends of the Covenant, and our fir≈øt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, and we beleived that the bringing home of the King to his Parliament, was the only means, which might perfect the work in hand, and we were verily per≈øwaded, that our pre≈øent and pre≈ø≈øing troubles, could no wayes have a period, but by a free convention betwixt King, and Subjects in Parliament, conceiving that to be the means to remove all mi≈øtakes and mi≈ø-under≈øtanding, betwixt King and people, we ≈øhall not ≈øtand to rehear≈øe all the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, Vowes, and prote≈øtations put upon us by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the maintenance of the prote≈øtant Religion, the Kings honour, Per≈øon, and E≈øtate, the priviledges of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and the e≈øtabli≈øhed known Lawes of the Land, for which we fir≈øt ingaged both lives and fortunes, again≈øt tho≈øe we ≈øuppo≈øed were the Common Enemies. But now ≈øind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by wofull experience, that we are likely to be wor≈øe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈ølaved by a company, who behave them≈øelves like the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ki≈øh Janizary; in impo≈øing taxes on our e≈øtates, and forcing our per≈øon out to fight again≈øt we know not who, for woe know not what, to ≈øatisfie the bondles lu≈øts of a company
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:162364:3"/>of factious, ≈øeditious and covetous per≈øons, who have the influence and greate≈øt ≈øtroak in the hou≈øes and Army, wee know them very well, but ≈øhall forbeare to particularize them, til another oportunity, but it is not nece≈ø≈øary to in≈øert their names, by rea≈øon they are too well knowne to this Kingdome, the totall ruine and downfall of all religion, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and di≈øcipline, not only in this, but in the other two Kingdomes. And this we ≈øhould not offer, but upon good grounds, will prove what we ≈øay and declare; to be as true as their actions are unju≈øt and dangerous, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the wickedne≈ø≈øe of the≈øe men, we did not of a long time (and till now of late) de≈øerne the continuall masking them≈øelves under the names of Reformers, and would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øooth be called the hone≈øt and faithfull party, none more forward to ≈øpeak good words to the people, and make great promi≈øes, where and to whom≈øoever they came, of inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from ≈ølavery and pre≈ø≈øures, then they, when indeed (as is apparent) they meant nothing more then to de≈øtroy, and ruine them, Thus have they kept their vizards on for the≈øe many years to the blinding &amp; deluding of many poor ≈øoules in this Kingdome, who being thus mi≈ølead by their ≈øpecious pretents, and dauncing after their pipes, to the lo≈ø≈øe of both lives and e≈øtates under the≈øe men, by their fal≈øe ≈øugge≈øtions, in≈øomuch that the≈øe three Kingdomes have bled and groaned this many years to the de≈øperat hazard of their utter di≈ø≈øolution and lo≈øs.</p>
            <p>And now the≈øe men appearing in their own colours, and letting the world be ≈øpectators of their in≈øolencyes, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious carriages to the great terror and amazement of all mode≈øt and peaceable people.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:162364:3"/>
            <p>And truly had they not appeared thus audacious and bold, without limits or bonds as hye as the di≈øtruction of both King, Lords and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and that they pretend the hou≈øe of Commons to be the only ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream power, and that hou≈øe they will not take notice on, unles it be moulded of a party of their owne chu≈øing and faction.</p>
            <p>We ≈øay that was one main cau≈øe of our now declaring, and ingaging, And truly our affection were ≈øo great to that Army and Party both in the hou≈øe and City, that we would have willingly layd downe our lives to ju≈øtifie them, and who ≈øoever ≈øpoke again≈øt them, wee either thought them Malignants, or men voyd of grace, and charity, but now their in≈øolencies [and our burden] force us to ≈øpeake that which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore we ≈øhould have blu≈øht to think.</p>
            <p>And now we have great cau≈øe to ble≈ø≈øe God for his goodne≈ø≈øe, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king us ≈øuch clear di≈øcerners of their jugling and Machavonills demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, and do look upon it as the greate≈øt mercy that we are undeceived, in that we have ≈øome hopes left us to ≈øecure our ≈øelves &amp; help our poor di≈øtre≈ø≈øed fellow ≈øubjects from under the ejection ≈ølavery, which the≈øe men have brought us to wade to the knees in already, we cannot but beleive, but that this faction, which doth ≈øo predominate both in the hou≈øe and field, are of a Je≈øuiticall ≈øpirit, knowing very well that that Army abounds with Prei≈øts and Je≈øuits, under who≈øe Councells wee cannot think our ≈øelves in ≈øafety, or this Kingdome, ≈øince they are the only men, that carryes on and hath the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, and hath the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaction of mo≈øt things done both in the hou≈øe and Army, the≈øe things appearing plain to the under≈øtanding of us, we conceived we could not pro≈øper, nor expect a ble≈øing from heaven ≈øo long as we remain ≈øilent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it had plea≈øed our maker to make us knowers off, &amp; ≈øince it is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ≈øo great concernment as Religion, law and liberty; we doubt not but we ≈øhall have a≈øsi≈øtence from Heaven above, and al hone≈øt and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men who love the happine≈ø≈øe flouri≈øhing of 3 (now dying Kingdoms) which mu≈øt inevitably come to ruine, if we ≈øuffer the≈øe cruell Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Taskma≈øters thus to rule over us, which ≈ølavery we are re≈øolved to quit our ≈øelves from, and bring our ≈øelves from under; and we doubt not but heaven will ≈ømile upon us as well as it did when we were abu≈øed by an exorbitant power gotten from the King by a party who loved him not.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:162364:4"/>
            <p>And now we ≈øhall declare who we will not have to bare rule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt us.</p>
            <p n="1">1 We declare again≈øt that party who denyed to ob≈øerve the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Orders at <hi>New-market</hi> and ingaged them≈øelves contrary to the Orders, Votes, and Re≈øolution of both hou≈øes, to ≈øtand in Armes, till they were ≈øatisfied in unju≈øt and trea≈øonable demands.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We Declare again≈øt tho≈øe who violently carried his Maje≈øty away from <hi>Holmby,</hi> contrary to the Order, Votes, and Ordinances of both hou≈øes of Parliament, from hou≈øe to hou≈øe whither they plea≈øed on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe to force him to own them in their trea≈øonable undertakings.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We declare again≈øt that party which de≈øerted the hou≈øe and ran to the Army, and brought them into the City of <hi>London,</hi> and joyned with them for the expelling and driving away all the hone≈øt Godly pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable members of the hou≈øes and City.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We declare again≈øt tho≈øe who plotted, contrived and effected his Maje≈øties impri≈øonment, and the party ≈øet on in the time of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øties impri≈øonment, to poy≈øon or take away his ≈øacred life.</p>
            <p n="5">5. We declare again≈øt all tho≈øe which have broken the peace and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement betwixt us, and our brethren of <hi>Scotland.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. That Keligion may be e≈øtabli≈øhed according to the rule of Gods word, and as near to the Covenant as is po≈ø≈øible, admitting the example of be≈øt reformed Churches, and that Di≈øcipline may be ≈øpeedily ≈øet up, and put in execution to the bridling of licentious liberty, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroying and routing out of here≈øie and Schi≈øme,</p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:162364:4"/>
            <p n="3">3 That the Freedomes of Parliament and priviledges may be knowne and declared, to the end we may not be brought to a contempt of their Authority through ignorance, and that this pre≈øent Parliament would be plea≈øed to ≈øet a time for their ending, that ≈øo the ≈øubject may be ea≈øed of many taxes which now lyes upon them through and by their means.</p>
